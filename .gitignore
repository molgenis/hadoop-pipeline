# Ignores files in the main git directory unless explicitly mentioned.
# This so that files/archives created/added by the external files archive will not automatically be added,
# as well as tmp files that might be generated by unit testing (the current MRUnit temporary fix creates
# symlinks in the working directory to simulate distributed cache) and could appear in git when using it
# at the same time when unit tests are ran.
